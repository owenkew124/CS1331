1. I added a flag component to the Minesweeper game. The flag can be dragged with the mouse to a tile and a new flag is created
   in its place. The image file of the flag should be in the same folder as the java file to show up correctly.

2. I added different background colors for the visible tiles depending on how many mines they are bordering 
   (Green = 0 mines bordering, Yellow = 1, etc.).
